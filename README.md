# JavaScript developer recruitment task

## Requirements
Your main goal is to develop a Weather App that provides accurate weather information to users. To get started, here's what we're looking for:


- **API**: Utilise the weather data from the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/current) API.
- **Framework**: You're free to choose a framework for building the app. React is a great choice, but feel free to use any other framework you're comfortable with. Remember to support your code with TypeScript for that extra layer of awesomeness.
- **Dashboard**: Create a clean dashboard where users can view the basic weather information (temperature, humidity, weather description) of the cities they've added to their favourites.
- **City Search**: Users should be able to search for weather information by entering the name of a city.
- **Favourites**: Implement a feature that allows users to mark cities as favourites.
- **Sorting**: Provide an option to sort the displayed favourite cities by their names.
- **Filtering**: Add the ability to filter and display specific cities.
- **Detailed Weather**: Design a detailed screen to display comprehensive weather information for a chosen city, including the current weather and a 5-day forecast.

## Guidelines
- **UI Library**: Feel free to choose a UI library that you're comfortable with. Whether it's Tailwind, MaterialUI, or another, just let us know why you've picked it.
- **GitHub**: Put your amazing implementation on GitHub and share the repository link with our HR team.
- **Deployment**: Deploy your app using Static Web Hosting. Include the deployment link in the README.md file in your repository.
- **Commentary**: If you encounter any challenges along the way, please add a comment detailing the biggest issue.

If you can't make it on time, please share the most recent version with us and tell us what is missing and why you couldn't finish.

_Good luck!_
